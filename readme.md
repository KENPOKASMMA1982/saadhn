This is **NOT** an official product. This project does not attempt to reverse engineer the JioSaavn API or attempt to reimplement any part of the Saavn client. Any communication between the user and Saavn servers is handled by official JioSaavn Web itself; this is just a native wrapper for Saavn Web, like a browser.
